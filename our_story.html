            <p>The <b>Old Lady Gang (OLG)</b> was conceptualized in 2016, when husband and wife team, New York City native Todd Tucker & Atlanta, Georgia native Kandi Burruss-Tucker had the great idea of sharing some of the delicious down home Southern recipes, that Kandi was raised on as a child and has come to love as an adult, with the public. Although Kandi may credit herself for mastering some of the traditional family recipes, she also gives credit where credit is due; to her mother Joyce Jones, aunts Bertha Jones & Nora Wilcox, affectionately known as the “Old Lady Gang,” for teaching her a few things in the kitchen.</p><br>

<p>No Strangers to the Arts & Entertainment, it was only fitting that the Tuckers would choose the Castleberry Hill neighborhood in Atlanta, GA as the home for <b>The Old Lady Gang (OLG).</b> One of the city’s Historic + Art Districts, Castleberry Hill continues to grow in both the number of residents as well as retail and other establishments.</p><br>

<p><b>Joyce Jones, Bertha Jones</b> & <b>Nora Wilcox</b> are the original <b>OLG</b>. If there’s one thing that you don’t have to question, when it comes to these three firecrackers, is that family truly comes first as far as they’re concerned. They’re three enthusiastic sisters from Atlanta that certainly know their way around a kitchen.</p><br>

<p>We were first introduced to the <b>OLG</b> on Bravo TV’s Real Housewives of Atlanta. Whether they were revealing conspiracy theories, confirming the distance that their love will go, or bringing family issues to an order, they never failed to leave a lasting impression on you.</p><br>

<p>One thing is for certain, if these three women put as much love and dedication into their original recipes as they do into their families, we are guaranteed to have some of the best southern cuisine that the South has to offer.</p><br>
